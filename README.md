### A Creedo-Bot project
A twitter bot, responding and interacting with Twitter automatically.  
I might have other creative ideas implemented into the project  
involving constructing creative sentences from other user's tweets.

### Important code snippets & Information will be logged below
*The tools I am using are:*  
	1. Javascript  
	2. Node.js  
	3. NPM  

I have a Node server running on my DigitalOcean server which is able to GET data and POST data from Twitter.  
I make use of the `Twit` NPM package to achieve this functionality.  
The data is received in a JSON format and is parsed correctly.
