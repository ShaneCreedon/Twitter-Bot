### A Creedo-Bot project
> The basic idea is when a user tweets me or follows me they will receive a message, thanking them.  
> I might have other creative ideas implemented into the project involving constructing creative

### Important code snippets & Information will be logged below
The tools I am using are:  
	1. Javascript
	2. Node.js	
	3. NPM

I have a Node server running on my DigitalOcean server which is able to GET data and POST data from Twitter.  
I make use of the `Twit` NPM package to achieve this functionality.  
The data is received in a JSON format and is parsed correctly.
