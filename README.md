###### Current Iteration of the bot:
Currently the bot automatically retweets something interesting based on a selection of interesting topics.  
For example, the bot may retweet something interesting about software engineering in one tweet, and then may  
retweet something about gaming or art.  

This is based on an **array of topics** that I have initialised.  
The bot picks a random topic from the array using random.choice(array) and then finds a tweet that has  
a hashtag of the topic we randomly chose.
